# Understanding-and-Predicting-Property-Maintenance-Fines



INTRODUCTION:

This project is about a busnies problem related to Detroitâ€™s blight complication.
Blight is a term used to signify property or land that is in poor condition due to a lack of upkeep and maintenance. As a result, the property eventually becomes unsafe or uninhabitable. As a solution, the goverment started issuing maintenance fines to residents and owners of the respective properties. 
Because most of blight tickets were not paid, the aim of this project was to predict blight compliance and understand why the rate of compliance was so low. 

THE OBJETIVE: 

The objetive is to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.


DATA:

There are two data files for use in training and validating the models: train.csv and test.csv. Each row in these two files corresponds to a single blight ticket, and includes information about when, why, and to whom each ticket was issued. The target variable is compliance, which is True if the ticket was paid early, on time, or within one month of the hearing data, False if the ticket was paid after the hearing date or not at all, and Null if the violator was found not responsible. Compliance, as well as a handful of other variables that will not be available at test-time, are only included in train.csv.

File descriptions (Use only this data for training your model!)
readonly/train.csv - the training set (all tickets issued 2004-2011)
readonly/test.csv - the test set (all tickets issued 2012-2016)
readonly/addresses.csv & readonly/latlons.csv - mapping from ticket id to addresses, and from addresses to lat/lon coordinates. 
 Note: misspelled addresses may be incorrectly geolocated.
